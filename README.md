<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
## Project Description 
Last year NHS England found that one in five 8-16year olds had a probable mental disorder. Mental disorders are intrinsically linked to disturbance in mood. We decided to act for children younger than 8 and created a platform to guide them through their journey of emotional exploration. 

If our Mood Monsters could support young children to learn to identify, and acknowledge their mood, and provide them with coping strategies through play, maybe, just maybe we could reduce this shocking figure. 

We have targeted young children, but we donâ€™t expect them to go on this journey alone, so we have built a platform that they navigate with their nominated grown-up, who also deserves our support.
