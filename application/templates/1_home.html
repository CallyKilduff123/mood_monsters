                    <p><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong><br>The Mental Health of Children and Young People in England 2023 report, published by NHS England, found that 20% of 8 to 16-year-olds had a probable mental disorder in 2023 (that is 1 in 5 children!!)</p>
                    <p><strong>OUR SOLUTION:</strong><br>This platform provides a safe space to guide young children (aged 6-8 years), and their nominated grown-up, to to identify, acknowledge and track their mood in order to learn to navigate their emotions with the help of our Mood Monsters.</p>

                <div class="pt-4">
                    <p><strong>HOW IT WORKS FOR THE CHILD:</strong><br>The child interacts with a dashboard of Mood Monsters. They are invited to select the one that best describes how they are feeling. This is to help them to identify and acknowledge their overriding emotion.</p>
                    <p>This mood is logged in their mood diary and in return they can unlock pages to receive communication tips and coping strategies via fun, engaging activities related to their selected mood.</p>
                    <p>The aim is to give them lifelong tools to tackle different, and perhaps sometimes difficult emotions, and for their bravery, they receive badges for their participation in activities, and for engaging with their mood.</p>
                    <p><strong>HOW IT WORKS FOR THEIR GROWN-UP:</strong><br>The child’s nominated grown-up can track the child's progress via their logged mood diary and their achievement page.</p>
                    <p>They will receive a notification about the child’s last logged mood, which will unlock tips on starting the conversation about mood with children, as well as resources to help support the child through their mood exploration.</p>
